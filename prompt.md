I want to learn [TECHNOLOGY NAME] from scratch to become job-ready as a junior frontend developer for remote positions in Europe/America. Create a comprehensive learning guide that includes:

1. **What & Why** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What is [TECH] and what problem does it solve?
   - Why is it used in modern projects?
   - When should I use it vs alternatives?

2. **Core Concepts** (Explain like I'm learning for the first time)
   - List 5-7 fundamental concepts I MUST understand
   - Explain each concept clearly with real-world analogies
   - Show the mental model I should have

3. **Practical Setup** (Step-by-step)
   - How to install and configure properly
   - Recommended folder structure for scalable projects
   - Essential dependencies and why each is needed
   - Configuration files and their purpose

4. **Professional Code Organization**
   - ✅ Proper folder structure (where to put API calls, hooks, utilities, types)
   - ✅ File naming conventions (kebab-case, PascalCase, etc.)
   - ✅ How to organize: services folder for APIs, hooks folder for custom hooks, etc.
   - ✅ Separation of concerns (business logic vs UI)
   - ✅ When to create reusable utilities vs inline code

5. **Modern Syntax & Standards**
   - ✅ Use async/await (not .then() chains)
   - ✅ Use arrow functions appropriately
   - ✅ Proper error handling patterns (try/catch)
   - ✅ TypeScript types and interfaces where needed
   - ✅ ES6+ features to use
   - ❌ Outdated syntax to avoid

6. **Code Examples** (Production-ready patterns)
   - Show 5-8 common real-world use cases with complete code
   - Include proper folder structure for each example
   - Follow industry coding standards
   - Add comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT
   - Show both the file structure AND the code

7. **Best Practices & Anti-patterns**
   - ✅ DO: Modern best practices used in 2024-2025
   - ✅ DO: Proper error handling and loading states
   - ✅ DO: Clean code principles (DRY, SOLID when applicable)
   - ❌ DON'T: Outdated approaches or common mistakes
   - ❌ DON'T: Over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions
   - What to avoid that wastes time or causes bugs

8. **Integration Guide**
   - How does [TECH] work with React/Next.js?
   - How to combine with other tools (TypeScript, TanStack Query, Axios, etc.)
   - Real project architecture example with folder tree
   - Where this fits in the overall app structure

9. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Common performance pitfalls
   - Optimization techniques
   - When to optimize vs premature optimization

10. **Interview-Ready Knowledge**
    - Top 5-7 interview questions about [TECH]
    - Key terminology I need to know
    - What employers expect from junior devs
    - Code challenges I might face

11. **Gotchas & Troubleshooting**
    - Common errors and how to fix them
    - Debug tips and tools
    - Edge cases to watch out for

12. **Real Project Checklist**
    - Step-by-step: How to implement [TECH] in a new project
    - What files to create and where
    - Configuration checklist
    - Testing considerations

13. **Next Steps**
    - Mini project idea to practice (with requirements)
    - What to learn after mastering basics
    - Advanced features to explore later
    - Resources for going deeper

**Critical Requirements**: 
- Use ONLY latest 2024-2025 syntax and approaches
- Show proper folder structure with examples like:
  - `/src/services/` for API calls
  - `/src/hooks/` for custom hooks (TanStack Query, etc.)
  - `/src/lib/` or `/src/utils/` for utilities
  - `/src/types/` for TypeScript types
- Use async/await syntax, not promises with .then()
- Include TypeScript examples where relevant
- Show production-grade, maintainable code
- Follow industry naming conventions
- Explain WHEN to use patterns, not just HOW
- Focus on practical, job-ready knowledge for remote junior positions
- Keep explanations clear for someone learning first time


note: use nexjs(app router), tailwind css, and javascript not typescript. create a .md file  and save into it. and must be in bangla. if there is any inconvient please correct it or skipt it.
